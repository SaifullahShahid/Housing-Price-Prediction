## Introduction
Accurate price predictions help buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions. Using the California Housing dataset, which contains features such as median income, house age, average rooms, and geographic location, this project leverages regression algorithms to predict median house values. This approach combines data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to build a robust predictive system.

## Dataset

The Pricing Prediciton model utilizes the "California Housing Prices" obtained from Kaggle.
